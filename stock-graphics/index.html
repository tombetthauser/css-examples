  <h1>Stock Graphics Examples</h1>
  <p>Here are some examples of stock graphics specifically from unDraw, which has thousands of downloadable stock graphics for almost anything you can think of. All of them have customizable color themes and are SVGs meaning they will scale without getting pixelated etc. These are great but you can't use them too much or on every project without things starting to look generic but there are other resources out there like this so don't be afraid to google around and find something new!</p>

    <p>You can literally make these have whatever color theme you want before you download them for your project.</p>

    <img class="graphic-3" src="./graphics/contract-3.svg">

    <p>You can download them all as SVG files so they can display at any size. Try changing the window size to see how they scale!</p>

    <p>Here are some other random examples, note that they aren't all the same stylistically so keep digging to find something unique so all your projects don't look the same!</p>
